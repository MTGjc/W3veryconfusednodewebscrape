                <!--This is a link, the href value should contain the url or relative path to a page. / means the root folder of the directory structure-->

            <p>
                This page tunnels into the investigation of Jorge Luis Borges, I am trying to gather data including images, texts, website links that wraps and points to the same target, and to see if there can be any interesting result generated like the Quixote in Borges's "Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote": to repeat and reenact the same situation where the original author was at, and see if the similar outcome and work can be done again and iterate under that reenacted same situation. Or at least to build out a map about Borges visually for further explorations.
